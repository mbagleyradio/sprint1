PSEUDOCODE - SPRINT 1

I don't need the checkbox data for the POPUP, I need the data for the email
The POPUP gathers its own data

What I need is a separate server-side program that is passed the data from the popup AND the data from the checkbox, and THAT program spits out an email, and stores onto database
-----------------

program receives checkbox data (array of 9 bools - 1 for type of checkbox [ins or no ins] and 8 for checkbox options) and contact form data (a Person struct with string data members)

Declare data = "Insurance: " + Person.insurance + "Name: " + Person.name + "Phone Number: " + Person.number + "Email: " + Person.email	

IF bools[0] is true
	IF bools[1] is true
		data += "Multiplan"
	IF bools[2] is true
		data += "Neighborhood Health Plan"
	IF bools[3] is true
		data += "Optum Healthcare"
	IF bools[4] is true
		data += "Preferred Medical Plan"
	IF bools[5] is true
		data += "Private Healthcare Systems"
	IF bools[6] is true
		data += "UnitedHealthCare"
	IF bools[7] is true
		data += "Wellcare"
	IF bools[8] is true
		data += "Not listed"
ELSE IF bools[0] is false
	IF bools[1] is true
		data += "No cost for eligible uninsured"
	IF bools[2] is true
		data += "Uninsured sliding fee"
	IF bools[3] is true
		data += "Uninsured discount"
	IF bools[4] is true
		data += "Payment plans"
	IF bools[5] is true
		data += "F.A.P discount (financial assistance program)"
	IF bools[6] is true
		data += "Catastrophic care discount"
	IF bools[7] is true
		data += "Care credit card"
	IF bools[8] is true
		data += "Self-pay"
